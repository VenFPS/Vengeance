Quote from thread on Xonotic Forum:

"With the conflicts between the original Nexuiz community and Illfonic came Xonotic, a Nexuiz fork that claimed to be the successor to Nexuiz. 
However, this caused a discrepancy within the original Nexuiz community that divided it even further. Some people moved onto Xonotic, others stayed with Nexuiz. 
Even some people quit Nexuiz altogether (this was already happening with Nexuiz 2.5 and later). 
Xonotic has a much more simplified learning curve and does not share much similarities with Nexuiz as many claimed. 
Simply put, it should not be said that Xonotic is the true successor to Nexuiz, but rather a different game, with different goals and ideals.
Of course without development, Nexuiz will die as an open source project. As a solution to this issue, Vengeance is a new fork with a goal to retain key factors that made nexuiz so successful. 
While Xonotic may be catering to newer players and a lower skill base, Vengeance would be the oppposite; encouraging competitive gameplay, while keeping game mechanics similar to Nexuiz."
